# CIS 3260 – Introduction to Programming Individual Assignment 3

Submission:

- Add your full name and email address as comments on top of each python program. Add appropriate comments at other locations of your python programs for readability.
- Name your python program as IA3Q#.py. For example, for question #1, your program should have a name IA3Q1.py
- For each question, put corresponding answers in a word document. Name your word document as IA3.doc
- Submit following items into iCollege -&gt; Assessment -&gt; Assignment 3
- IA3.doc
- IA3Q1.py
- IA3Q2.py
- IA3Q3.py

Some Comments from your instructor:

I highly recommend you use PyCharm to write the following two programs. You can open an existing python project and create two new python files IA3Q1.py, IA3Q2.py, and IA3Q3.py.

# 1. Objectives: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3

1. [32 points] Assume that you're collaborating with an HR department to design software that calculates bonus pay based on an employee's weekly work hours. HR staff will input the number of hours, and the software will then display the corresponding bonus amount. If an employee works more than 45 hours in a week, they will receive a bonus of $2,000.

Sample Run 1:

Enter weekly work hours($): 45

Bonus pay is 2000

Sample Run 2:

Enter weekly work hours($): 41

Bonus pay is 0

A. [3 points] System Analysis: What is(are) the input(s) and output(s)?

B. [5 points] Suppose your manager requests that you implement this program using a single ONE-WAY decision selection statement. How would you describe the condition in plain English? Additionally, how would you represent this condition as a Boolean expression in Python?

C. [5 points] System Design: List the steps to get output(s) from input(s).

D. [5 points] Write your program, copy, and paste your source code here.

E. [2 points] Please attach a screenshot displaying a sample run of your program.
2. Share with us TWO errors you experienced when writing this program. [ It is common to experience errors. I will be surprised if you do not see any errors. In case this happens, you can make some errors by yourself.]

# 2. Objectives: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, 3.7

# 1) [34 points] You are currently developing educational software to teach children about multiples of 5. In the application, children are prompted to input a number ranging from 0 to 100 (inclusive). The software then displays a message indicating whether the provided number is a multiple of 5 within the specified range.

Sample Run 1:

Enter a number between 0 and 100: 2

Sorry, 2 is not a multiple of 5 in the range from 0 and 100

Sample Run 2:

Enter a number between 0 and 100: 115

Sorry, 115 is not a multiple of 5 in the range from 0 and 100

Sample Run 3:

Enter a number between 0 and 100: 20

Yes, 20 is a multiple of 5 in the range from 0 and 100

# A. [5 points] System Analysis: What is(are) the input(s) and output(s)?

# B. [5 points] Assume you are going to use a single TWO-WAY decision selection statement. How would you describe the condition in plain English? Additionally, how would you represent this condition as a Boolean expression in Python? You may need to use logical operator.

# C. [5 points] System Design: List the steps to get output(s) from input(s)

# D. [5 points] Write your program, copy, and paste your source code here.

# E. [2 points] Please attach a screenshot displaying a sample run of your program.

# 3. Objectives: 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7

# 1) [34 points] Assume you are going to develop an application on a mobile phone. The
application allows the user to type a lowercase letter, and then it displays the corresponding
number. The mapping rule is shown below:

| | |2abe|3 del|
|---|---|---|---|
| | |5 ikl|6mno|
| |pqrs| | |

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a lowercase letter and displays its corresponding number.

Sample Run 1:

Enter a lowercase letter: a

The corresponding number is 2

Sample Run 2:

Enter a lowercase letter: A

Invalid input

# A. [5 points] System Analysis: What is(are) the input(s) and output(s)?

# B. [5 points] Assume you are going to use a single MULTIPLE-WAY decision selection statement. In plain English, how would you describe the condition that prompts the program to display the number 4. Additionally, how would you represent this condition as a Boolean expression in Python? You may need to use logical operator.

# C. [5 points] System Design: List the steps to get output(s) from input(s)

# D. [5 points] Write your program, copy, and paste your source code here.

# E. [2 points] Please attach a screenshot displaying a sample run of your program.
