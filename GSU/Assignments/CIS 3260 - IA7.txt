# CIS 3260 – Introduction to Programming

# Individual Assignment 7

Submission:

- Add your full name and email address as comments on top of each python program. Add appropriate comments at other locations of your python programs for readability.
- Name your python program as IA7Q#.py. For example, for question #1, your program should have a name IA7Q1.py
- For each question, put corresponding answers in a word document. Name your word document as IA7.doc
- Submit following items into iCollege -&gt; Assessment -&gt; Assignment 7
- IA7.doc
- IA7Q1.py
- IA7Q2Covert.py
- IA7Q2Test.py

Some Comments from your instructor:

I highly recommend you use PyCharm to write following two programs. You can open existing python project and create two new python files IA7Q1.py, IA7Q2Covert.py and IA7Q2Test.py.

# 1. Objectives: 6.1-6.5

# 1) [33 points] Let us develop a tool to display number of days in years. We ask user to enter the start year and end year. Then our program should print out a table to show the corresponding results.

Assume that you are requested to write a function that returns the number of days in a year. Then your program can call this function repeatedly and display the number of days in the years from the given range.

Sample Run

Enter a start year: 2000

Enter an end year: 2005

|year|days|
|---|---|
|2000|366|
|2001|365|
|2002|365|
|2003|365|
|2004|366|
|2005|365|

A. [5 points] How to define the header of the function returning the number of days in a year?

You can use any names for the function and parameter.

B. [5 points] How to define the body of the function at question A)? (Please write down a complete function definition including both header and body). Note: The function does not print out any messages.

C. [5 points] How to call the function at question A)? (Please provide one example.)

D. [5 points] Assume we use a for loop to display the table, how to write the for loop header.

E. [5 points] Continue question D), how to write the for loop body.

# F. [8 points] Write your program and put your source code here.

# G. [5 points] A screenshot of the output of program

# 2) Share with us TWO error you experienced when writing this program.

# I. Error 1

A. [2 pts] Explain what is the type of the error (syntax, run-time, or logical error)?
B. [2 pts] How you resolve it?
C. [2 pts] How much time you spent to resolve it?

# II. Error 2

A. [2 pts] Explain what is the type of the error (syntax, run-time, or logical error)?
B. [2 pts] How you resolve it?
C. [2 pts] How much time you spent to resolve it?

# 2. [ Objectives: 6.1-6.5，6.7]

# 1) [36 points] Let us write two python programs “IA7Q2Covert.py” and “IA7Q2Test.py” in this programming task.

“IA7Q2Covert.py” defines two functions celsiusToFahrenheit and fahrenheitToCelsius. The headers of functions are as below:

|# Converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit|def celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius)|
|---|---|
|# Converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius|def fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit) :|

“IA7Q2Test.py” uses the functions from “IA7Q2Test.py”. “IA7Q2Test.py” asks the user to select a conversion task and enter a temperature as guided.

Hint: The formulas for the conversion are:

celsius = (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit – 32)

fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32

Sample Run

1. Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

2. Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

Enter your choice (1 or 2): 1

Enter a temperature in Celsius: 25

Fahrenheit is 77

# A. [5 points] System Analysis:

What is(are) the input(s) and output(s)? For program "IA7Q2Test.py"

# B. [6 points] System Design:

List the steps to get output(s) from input(s) in English for program "IA7Q2Test.py"

# C. [6 points]

How to use the functions from "IA7Q2Covert.py"? Describe the steps in English.

# D. [8 points]

Write your program "IA7Q2Covert.py" and put your source code here.

# E. [8 points]

Write your program "IA7Q2Test.py" and put your source code here.
