## 2)
- [18 points] Write a program that prompts the user to enter the currency exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Chinese Renminbi (RMB). Prompt the user to enter 0 to convert from U.S. dollars to Chinese RMB and 1 for vice versa. Prompt the user to enter the amount in U.S. dollars or Chinese RMB to convert it to Chinese RMB or U.S. dollars, respectively. Here are some sample runs:

### Sample Run 1
- Enter the exchange rate from dollars to RMB: 6.81
- Enter 0 to convert dollars to RMB and 1 vice versa: 0
- Enter the dollar amount: 100

### Sample Run 2
- Enter the exchange rate from dollars to RMB: 6.81
- Enter 0 to convert dollars to RMB and 1 vice versa: 1
- Enter the RMB amount: 681

- Choice (0 or 1) for conversion direction
- RMB amount

**Outputs:**
- Converted amount in dollars

# Two-Way Selection Statement
B. **Condition for Two-Way Selection:**
- If the choice is 0, convert dollars to RMB
- If the choice is 1, convert RMB to dollars

**Boolean Expression in Python:**
```python
if choice == 0:
# Convert dollars to RMB
elif choice == 1:
# Convert RMB to dollars
```

# System Design
C. **Steps to Get Output:**
1. Input exchange rate from dollars to RMB
2. Input choice (0 or 1) for conversion direction
3. Input RMB amount
4. Based on the choice:
- If choice is 0, convert dollars to RMB using the exchange rate
- If choice is 1, convert RMB to dollars using the exchange rate
5. Display the converted amount in the required currency

# Program Source Code
D. **Python Program:**
```python
exchange_rate = float(input("Enter the exchange rate from dollars to RMB: "))
choice = int(input("Enter 0 to convert dollars to RMB and 1 vice versa: "))
amount = float(input("Enter the RMB amount: "))

if choice == 0:
converted_amount = amount / exchange_rate
print(f"{amount} yuan is {converted_amount:.2f} dollar")
elif choice == 1:
converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate
print(f"{amount} dollar is {converted_amount:.2f} yuan")
```

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter two characters and displays the status and major represented in the characters.

The first character is a number 1, 2, 3, or 4, indicating whether a student is a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior; the second character indicates the major.

Suppose the following characters are used to denote the majors:
- C: Computer Information Systems
- F: Finance

## Sample Run 1
- Enter First Character: F
- Enter Second Character: 1
- Output:
- Finance
- Freshman

- Computer Information Systems
- Sophomore

### A. System Analysis
- Inputs: Two characters entered by the user
- Outputs: Status (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and Major (Computer Information Systems, Finance)

### B.
- Condition to check if the input is for a senior in Computer Information Systems:
- Condition: c1 == '4' and c2 == 'C'
- Boolean Expression in Python: c1 == '4' and c2 == 'C'

### C. System Design
- Steps to get outputs from inputs:
1. Prompt the user to enter the first character
2. Store the input in variable c1
3. Prompt the user to enter the second character
4. Store the input in variable c2
5. Use a multiple-way selection statement to determine the status and major based on the values of c1 and c2
6. Display the status and major based on the inputs provided by the user
