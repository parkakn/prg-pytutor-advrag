# Exercise 2.3


# Objectives 2.3, 2.8

1. Suppose m and r are integers. Write a Python expression for mr2. What is 2 * 23?

2. Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:

area = radius * radius * Ï€

volume = area * length

Sample Run

Enter the radius of a cylinder: 5.5

Enter the length of a cylinder: 12.9

The area is 95.0330975

The volume of the cylinder is 1225.92695775
