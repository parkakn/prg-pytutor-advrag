# Objectives 2.1, 2.3, 2.4

1. Analyze the following code?

interestRate = 0.05

2. Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mistakes. For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell print wrong?

This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.

- We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n?
- How about x = y = 1?
- In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement?
- What if you put a period at the end of a statement?
- In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: x y. What happens if you try that in Python?
