# Exercise 2.5


(Objective 2.11)

Let us apply the software development process to the following problem. Describe what you get after completing the system analysis and system design stage separately.

Write a program that reads in an investment amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of years, and then displays the future investment value using the following formula:

futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount Ã— (1 + monthlyInterestRate) ^ numberOfMonths

For example, if you enter the amount 1000, an annual interest rate of 4.25%, and the number of years as 1, the future investment value is 1043.33.
