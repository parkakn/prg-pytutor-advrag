### Course Overview:
This online introductory programming course focuses on Python and is designed for students who have completed CIS 2010 with at least a grade of C. It covers fundamental programming concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and practical application of these concepts through projects and assignments.

### Course Objectives:
Upon completion, students will be able to:
1. Create, debug, execute, and test Python applications.
2. Apply OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) in Python class implementations.

### Course Materials:
- **Main Textbook:** Y. Daniel Liang, “Introduction to Python Programming and Data Structures 3e”
- **Supplementary Textbooks:** Options include "Think Python" and "Learning Python".
- **Platforms:** Coding Rooms for practical exercises.
