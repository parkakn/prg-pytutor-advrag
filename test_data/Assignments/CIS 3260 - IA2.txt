# CIS 3260 – Introduction to Programming
## Individual Assignment 2

### Submission:
- Add your full name and email address as comments on top of each python program. Add appropriate comments at other locations of your python programs for readability.
- Name your python program as IA2Q#.py. For example, for question #1, your program should have a name IA2Q1.py.
- For each question, put corresponding answers in a word document. Name your word document as IA2.doc.
- Submit the following items into iCollege -> Assessment -> Assignment 2:
- IA2.doc
- IA2Q1.py
- IA2Q2.py

### [Some Comments from your instructor]:
I highly recommend you use PyCharm to write the following two programs. You can open an existing python project and create two new python files IA2Q1.py and IA2Q2.py.

### 1. [Objectives: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.10, 2.11]

1) Let us continue Exercise 2.5, write a program that reads in an investment amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of years, and then displays the future investment value using the following formula. Please display the future investment value with two digits after the decimal point.
- **Formula**:
\[
\text{futureInvestmentValue} = \text{investmentAmount} \times (1 + \text{monthlyInterestRate})^{\text{numberOfMonths}}
\]
- **Sample Run**:
```
Enter investment amount: 1000.56
Enter annual interest rate: 4.25
Enter number of years: 1
Future investment value is 1043.92
```

# Introduction to Programming Assignment

## Objectives:
- 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 2.11

### Task 1: Gratuity Calculator
1. Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate and computes the gratuity and total.
- For example, if the user enters 10 for the subtotal and 15 for the gratuity rate (we use 0.15 in our program as the gratuity rate), the program displays 1.5 as the gratuity and 11.5 as the total.

**A. [5 points]** What is(are) the input(s) and output(s)?

**B. [5 points]** List the steps to get output(s) from input(s).

**C. [5 points]** Write your program and put your source code here.

**D. [5 points]** A screenshot of the output of the program.

### Task 2: Error Analysis
2. Share with us TWO errors you experienced when writing this program.

**I. Error 1**
- **A. [5 pts]** Explain what is the type of the error (syntax, run-time, or logical error)?
- **B. [5 pts]** How did you resolve it?
- **C. [5 pts]** How much time did you spend to resolve it?

**II. Error 2**
- **A. [5 pts]** Explain what is the type of the error (syntax, run-time, or logical error)?
- **B. [5 pts]** How did you resolve it?
- **C. [5 pts]** How much time did you spend to resolve it?
