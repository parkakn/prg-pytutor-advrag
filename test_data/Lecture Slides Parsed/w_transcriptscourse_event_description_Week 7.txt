### Weekly Lecture Summary for Introductory Programming Course (Week 7)

**General Purpose:**
This week’s lecture focused on Chapter 4, highlighting mathematical functions, string representation and processing, character encoding using ASCII and Unicode, and examining string operations in Python.

---

#### **Main Topics Covered:**

1. **Mathematical Functions**:
   - Introduction to solving mathematical problems using Python's built-in functions.
   - Functions such as `max()`, `min()`, `round()`, `abs()`, and `pow()` were discussed, along with examples of their usage.

2. **Math Module**:
   - Comprehensive coverage of the math module, introducing functions like:
     - `fabs()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`, `exp()`, `log()`, `sqrt()`, and trigonometric functions (`sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`).
   - Explanation of how to import the math library and use its functions effectively.

3. **Strings Representation**:
   - Discussed the concept of strings as sequences of characters and the distinction between single-character strings and multi-character strings in Python.
   - Demonstrated string literals enclosed in single or double quotes.

4. **Character Encoding**:
   - Detailed exploration of ASCII and Unicode encoding.
   - ASCII encoding covers 256 characters, whereas Unicode accommodates 65,536 characters (the representation of various international symbols and characters).
   - Introduced functions `ord()` (to obtain a numerical code for a character) and `chr()` (to convert a numerical code back to a character).

5. **Escape Sequences**:
   - Explained how to represent special characters using escape sequences (e.g., `\n` for new lines, `\t` for tabs).
   - Demonstrated practical examples of escape sequences in string literals.

6. **Testing Substrings**:
   - Introduced the `in` and `not in` operators for testing substring existence within strings.
   - Practical example with conditional statements to check if a substring is present.

7. **String Comparison**:
   - Covered methods to compare strings based on their Unicode/ASCII values and order.

8. **String Functions**:
   - Discussed built-in string functions such as `len()`, `min()`, and `max()` to operate on string data.

#### **Critical Details:**

- **Importing Libraries**: Remember to use `import math` to access the math module's functions, prefixed by `math.` when calling them in your code.
- **Escape Sequences**: Essential for dealing with characters that have special meanings (e.g., quotes, tabs, newlines) within strings.
- **Unicode vs. ASCII**: Understanding the distinction is critical for encoding and properly displaying text in programs.
- **Functionality of `ord()` and `chr()`**: These functions enhance the ability to manipulate and understand character encodings.
